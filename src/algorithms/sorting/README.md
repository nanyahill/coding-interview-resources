According to D. Knuth, the sorting algorithms can be grouped into:

1) Sorting by Insertion (Insertion Sort & Shell Sort)
   - Items are considered one at a time, and each new item is inserted into its appropriate position relative to previously-sorted items.
2) Sorting by Exchanging (Bubble Sort & Quick Sort)
   - If two items are found to be out of order, they are exchanged. This process continues until no more exchanges are necessary.
3) Sorting by Selection (Selection Sort)
   - The smallest (or largest) item is selected and stored away. Then the next smallest (or largest) item is selected, and so on.
4) Sorting by Merging (Merge Sort)
   - Two sorted sequences are combined by comparing the smallest items in each list and storing the smallest in a final sequence, and then repeat the same process.
5) Sorting by Distribution (Counting Sort, Bucket Sort & Radix Sort)
   - Each element is "counted" and its final position is determined by the number of elements that it exceeds.
