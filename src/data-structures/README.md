What are data-structures? A bunch of algorithms that help you store or retrieve information. Two main algorithms used in data structures:
- Queries: find, ask any question
- Updates: Inserts and Deletes
You start with an empty data structures, then throw data at it and then query it.
Example data structures:
Data Structure        Query             Update
Sorted Array           binary search
Unsorted Array
LinkedList
Stack
Queue
Binary Tree
BST
Heaps


DS have this property: Representation Invariant: Data in a DS is organized in a certain manner and
as long as it is organized in this way, the data structure functions correctly.
Sorted Array: RI = every element is sorted
