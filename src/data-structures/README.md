What are data-structures? A bunch of algorithms that help you store or retrieve information. Two main algorithms used in data structures:
- Queries: find, ask any question
- Updates: Inserts and Deletes
You start with an empty data structures, then throw data at it and then query it.
Example data structures:
Data Structure        Query             Update
Sorted Array           binary search
Unsorted Array
LinkedList
Stack
Queue
Binary Tree
BST
Heaps


DS have this property: Representation Invariant: Data in a DS is organized in a certain manner and
as long as it is organized in this way, the data structure functions correctly.
Sorted Array: RI = every element is sorted

More organized list of Data Structures
Arrays- commonly used for searching problems.
LinkedLists
Stacks
Queues
Binary Trees
    Heaps- commonly used in sorting problems
Dictionaries (a group of records, each identified by one or more key fields)
    HashTables- commonly used in searching problems
    Binary Search Trees- commonly used in searching problems
Graphs
Specialized data structures
    Suffix Trees/Arrays (used to preprocess Strings to make pattern matching faster)
    k-d trees (Spatial data structures)
    Graphs
    Sets
