Graphs
- A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph in which there are no cycles.
- In a DAG, vertices with no incoming edges are referred to as sources and vertices with no outgoing edges are referred to as sink.
- In an undirected graph, vertices u and v are connected, if the graph contains a path fom u to v.
- A graph is connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected.
- A connected component is a maximal set of vertices C such that each pair of vertices in C is connected in G.


- A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
