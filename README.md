Resources to help prepare for coding interviews.

### This repository is still under construction

> This repository serves as a way to brush up on CS fundamnetals required for coding interviews. Below, the topics related to Data Strcutures and Algorithms have been grouped as per my understanding thus far. Also, I have added helpful articles that I found when studying each of these topics.

Concepts:
- Recursion
- Big O complexity

Data Structures:
- Arrays
- LinkedLists
- Stacks and Queues
- Binary Trees
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Binary Search Trees

Algorithms:
- Searching
- Sorting
  - Comparison-based
    - Selection Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - #### Shell Sort
      ##### Key Ideas:
	      - Improves insertion sort algorithm by splitting original array into multiple subarrays, then h-sort subarrays.
	      - The split happens by choosing an appropriate decrementing sequence of h values that ends in 1. For example, 10, 5, 2, 1.
	      - Each value of h is called a gap.
	      - The choice of the decrementing sequence is ######key to shell sort and can lead to better time complexity. 
	      - By sorting subarrays, elements are moved closer to their correct position.
	      - A subarray consists of elements that are h elements apart.
	      - When h is 1, shell sort becomes simply insertion sort
        - For any given gap, multiple subarrays can exist. Example: Using a gap of 3, the below array has three subarrays.
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
  - Non-Comparison based
    - Radix Sort
    - Counting Sort
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
